# Battleship
This is an implementation of the classic board game battleships using HTML, CSS and of course JS. This project is part of the Odin Project Curriculum (it's the last project in the JS course).

## How To Play
There are two grids - one representing enemy territory and one representing your territory. Each grid is made of 10x10 cells that could click on to attck. The enemy ships are hidden, and only appear after they've been sunk.

## Thoughts
I really enjoyed working on this project. I admit it was'nt easy in the least but it was fun, enlightening and inspiring. I learnt alot from making this game and i hope i'll be able to put what i've learnt to good use. I do hope that you enjoy the game as much as i do - i put a lot of effort into making sure it's a great basic game, perhaps it won't be a reach to say i went all out on this one - but i'll leave that for you to decide. 

In the meantime, i'm super excited and looking forward t0 start the react course. Vanilla JS course was amazing, thank you TOP!!.
